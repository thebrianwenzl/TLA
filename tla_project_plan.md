5. **Clean State**: No broken functionality from previous phases

### Phase Completion Checklist
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code committed to version control
- [ ] Basic testing completed
- [ ] API endpoints documented (if applicable)
- [ ] Next phase dependencies confirmed ready

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier configured
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Proper input validation on all endpoints
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Basic UI testing for critical flows
- Manual testing checklist for each phase

### Communication Protocol
- Daily progress updates
- Immediate notification of blockers
- Demo sessions at phase completion
- Technical questions addressed within 24 hours

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Implement indexes from Phase 2
- **Mobile Performance**: Test on actual devices, not just simulators
- **State Management Complexity**: Keep Redux slices focused and simple
- **API Response Times**: Implement caching strategy early

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to phase definitions, defer enhancements
- **Integration Issues**: Test integration points at each phase
- **Device Compatibility**: Test on multiple iOS/Android versions

### Contingency Plans
- If Phase 4 complexity exceeds estimates, implement basic game first, enhance later
- If mobile performance issues arise, implement optimization in separate mini-phase
- If database design needs changes, create migration strategy
